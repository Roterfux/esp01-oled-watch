 *  This sketch demonstrates how to scan WiFi networks. 
 *  The API is almost the same as with the WiFi Shield library, 
 *  the most obvious difference being the different file you need to include:
 *  Comes with Arduino ESP8266 build under examples..
 
 Modified by DanBicks added OLED display to ESP01 using cheap Ebay 0.96" display
 Lightweight Mike-Rankin OLED routines added in this project, Credits to Mike for this.
